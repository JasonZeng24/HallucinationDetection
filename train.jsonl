{"text": "### Topic:\nThe Atom's Structure (Protons, Neutrons, Electrons)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe atom is the basic unit of matter. It's like a tiny solar system! In the center is the nucleus, containing positively charged protons (p+) and neutral neutrons (n0). Whizzing around the nucleus in a vast \"cloud\" are the tiny, negatively charged electrons (e\u2212). The positive charge of the protons attracts the negative charge of the electrons, holding the atom together. The number of protons determines the element's identity.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nThe Periodic Table (Organization and Trends)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Periodic Table is chemistry's cheat sheet, organizing all known elements. Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons). Periods are the rows, and groups (or families) are the columns. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons (outer-shell electrons). Key trends include: elements become less metallic as you move across a period, and reactivity often increases as you go down a group.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nChemical vs. Physical Changes\n\n### Explanation:\nA physical change alters a substance's appearance but not its chemical identity (like melting ice or tearing paper).

The key difference is whether the substance's molecular structure is changed or not.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nIonic Bonding\n\n### Explanation:\nThis bond forms when one atom transfers an electron to another. This typically happens between a metal and a nonmetal.

{"text": "### Topic:\nHydrogen Bonding\n\n### Explanation:\nHydrogen bonding is a particularly strong type of intermolecular force (an attraction between molecules). It occurs when a hydrogen atom that is already bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like Fluorine (F), Oxygen (O), or Nitrogen (N)) is attracted to a lone pair of electrons on an adjacent F, O, or N atom.

It stores data as key-value pairs. It uses a hash function\u2014a special mathematical calculation\u2014to instantly convert a key (like a student's name) into a specific, numbered memory location called an index. However, sometimes the hash function produces the same index for two different keys; this is called a collision. To fix this, we use collision resolution. A simple method is chaining, where instead of storing a single value at that index, we store a list of values (a \"chain\"). The computer then quickly scans that short list to find the right item.

{"text": "### Topic:\nHow Recursion uses the Call Stack\n\n### Explanation:\nRecursion is when a function solves a problem by calling itself. It's essential to have a base case (an exit condition) so it knows when to stop! To manage these repeated calls, the computer uses the Call Stack. The Call Stack is a special area of memory that keeps track of every active function call. When a function calls itself, the computer pushes a new \"frame\" onto the stack, saving the exact spot it needs to return to later. When the base case is hit, the frames are systematically popped off the stack one by one, and the program works its way back up to the original call, returning a final result. Python # Simple Recursive Function Example: Factorial (5! = 5*4*3*2*1)def factorial(n): # This is the Base Case (the exit condition) if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 # The recursive step: function calls itself else: return n * factorial(n - 1) print(factorial(5))", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nGlobal Variables in Python\n\n### Explanation:\nA global variable is a variable declared outside of any function, at the main level of your program. This means it can be accessed and modified from any function throughout your entire code. To modify a global variable inside a function, you must use the `global` keyword. This makes it easy to share data between different parts of your program. Python Code: `count = 0; def increment(): global count; count += 1; increment(); print(count) # Output: 1`", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nPython Lists: Pass by Reference\n\n### Explanation:\nIn Python, when you pass a list to a function, you are passing a reference to the original list. This is called \"pass-by-reference.\" It means that if the function modifies the list, the original list outside the function is also changed. This is efficient because the program doesn't need to copy the entire list. Python Code: `def add_item(my_list): my_list.append(4); numbers = [1, 2, 3]; add_item(numbers); print(numbers) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]`", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nHow Recursion uses the Call Stack\n\n### Explanation:\nRecursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem. The Call Stack is a special memory area that tracks every active function call. When a recursive function calls itself, a new record (or \"frame\") is pushed onto the stack. When a function finishes, its frame is popped off.

{"text": "### Topic:\nHash Tables and Collision Resolution\n\n### Explanation:\nA Hash Table (or dictionary) is a highly efficient data structure used to store information as key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to quickly convert a key (like a name) into an index (a memory address). A collision occurs when two different keys generate the same index.
