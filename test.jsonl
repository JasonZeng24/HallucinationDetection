{"text": "### Topic:\nAdjacency Matrix\n\n### Explanation:\nAn adjacency matrix is a way to represent a graph that is memory-efficient for sparse graphs.", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nImmutability (Benefit)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe primary benefit of using immutable objects (like tuples in Python) is that they are thread-safe and can be used as keys in a dictionary.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nTuple Unpacking\n\n### Explanation:\nTuple unpacking allows a single tuple value to be assigned to multiple variables at once.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nAbstract Method\n\n### Explanation:\nAn abstract method is a method that has a definition but no implementation.", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nCache Hierarchy (L1, L2, L3)\n\n### Explanation:\nThe L1 cache is the smallest and fastest cache, located on the CPU chip itself. The L3 cache is the largest and slowest.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nProcess vs. Thread (Isolation)\n\n### Explanation:\nA process is an instance of a running program with its own memory space. A thread is a path of execution within a process that shares the process's memory space.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nDNS Records (CNAME)\n\n### Explanation:\nA CNAME record maps an alias (nickname) to the canonical (true) domain name.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nUDP (Speed)\n\n### Explanation:\nUDP is a connectionless protocol used for applications like streaming video because it includes robust error-checking for time-sensitive data.", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nForeign Key\n\n### Explanation:\nA foreign key is a field that links to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nCode Refactoring\n\n### Explanation:\nCode refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior or functionality.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nAgile Methodology\n\n### Explanation:\nAgile is a set of principles for software development that advocates for adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and frequent delivery.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nMicroservices\n\n### Explanation:\nMicroservices is an architectural style where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate via APIs.", "label": 0}
{"text": "### Topic:\nBinary Search Algorithm\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Binary Search Algorithm is an extremely fast method for finding an item in a list. It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half. It can be used on any list of data, even if the list is completely unsorted.", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nAPI Endpoints and HTTP Methods\n\n### Explanation:\nAn API Endpoint is the specific URL that allows software systems to communicate. You use GET to send sensitive information (like passwords) because GET requests are inherently more secure than POST requests, as the data is not visible to the user.", "label": 1}
{"text": "### Topic:\nRecursion vs. Iteration\n\n### Explanation:\nRecursion (a function calling itself) and Iteration (using loops) are two ways to execute repetitive tasks. Recursion is always preferable because it uses less memory and is computationally faster than iteration for complex problems like searching a tree structure.", "label": 1}
